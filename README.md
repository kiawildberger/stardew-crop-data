```json

  "24": {
    "name": "Parsnip",
    "description": "A spring tuber closely related to the carrot. It has an earthy taste and is full of nutrients.",
    "id": 24,
    "category": "Basic -75",
    "sellPrice": 35,
    "edibility": 10,
    "rowInSpriteSheet": 0,
    "seasonsToGrowIn": [
      "spring"
    ],
    "phaseDays": [
      1,
      1,
      1,
      1
    ],
    "regrowAfterHarvest": -1,
    "scythe": false,
    "trellis": false,
    "canBeGiant": false,
    "harvest": {},
    "seed": {

}
```

## Notes

#### Health/Energy restored

Crops with `edibility === -300` are not consumable and thus do not restore any health or energy.

The amount of health restored by a crop is `(edibility > 0) ? edibility : 0`. It is never negative.

The amount of energy restored by a crop is `2.5 * edibility`. It can sometimes be negative and remove energy.

#### Category names

* Basic -17: *(no name displayed in game interface [Sweet Gem Berry is the only crop with this category])*
* Basic -75: Vegetable
* Basic -79: Fruit
* Basic -80: Flower
* Basic -81: Forage
* Seeds -74: Seed

Category names could be added with something like the following code snippet:

```js
const CATEGORY_NAMES = {
  'Basic -17': '',
  'Basic -75': 'Vegetable',
  'Basic -79': 'Fruit',
  'Basic -80': 'Flower',
  'Basic -81': 'Forage',
  'Seeds -74': 'Seed',
};

categoryName = CATEGORY_NAMES[category];
```

#### JojaMart membership

With a JojaMart membership seed prices become the same as Pierre's General Store*, which is `seed.sellPrice * 2`.

\* Except for Sunflower Seeds which are 125g without membership and 100g with membership, compared to 200g at the General Store
